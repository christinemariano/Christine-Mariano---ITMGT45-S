<body>
    <p>Digital Espresso began in 1945 when our founder, Ricardo Dalisay, a coffee enthusiast and a skilled barista, decided to pursue his passion for coffee by opening a small coffee shop in the heart of Berlin. Cardo's vision was to create a place where people could come together to enjoy great coffee, delicious pastries, and each other's company.
    </p>

    <p>Today, Digital Espresso continues to thrive, thanks to the dedication and hard work of its staff and the loyalty of its customers. As we look to the future, we remain committed to providing the highest quality coffee and pastries, along with a warm, welcoming atmosphere that makes everyone feel at home.
